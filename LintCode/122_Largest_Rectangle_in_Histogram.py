'''
Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

histogram

Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].

histogram

The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.

Example
Given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3],
return 10.

Left and right boudaries are the lowest bars to decide the width of the retangle. The height is the poped height which is the lowest in this width.
